-Version Control
 To get all modified code level changes and track those changes and with more details
 To track the changes of the original local file. Like which developer changed and who saved those changes and kind of details
 To maintain logs of the files
-We have 3 Version control technique
 Centralized
 Distributed/Grid/Decentralized
 Local
-Centralized Version Control Technique
 One server is available to all the developers 
 Always depends on Network availability
 Only one at a time can commit the changes to the centralized server file
 If server is unavailable then none of the users can use the server files
-Distributed/Grid/Decentralized
 In this concept, developer has local repository and all the changes first commited in Local repository then moves it to the Central server
 So all the changes are initially saved locally
 For On Premise they use Bit Bucket
 For Cloud environment they use gethub and getlab
-In this concept the file changes and commited to staging area then only goes to localrepo and then moved to Remote Server
 1.Working Directory (gitadd)
 2.Staging area(git commit)
 3.Localrepo(gitpush)
 4.Remote Repo(git pull/git push)

-To get GIT through ubuntu
 1. Log in to AWS https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-2#Instances:sort=instanceId
 2. Make sure the instance is UP and Running
 3. Copy the DNS from the Description console
 4. Open Putty and paste the copied DNS in Host Name
 5. In SSH->Auth Tab clisk on browse and select putty icon
 7.Log now to Putty and loh in name as ubuntu
 
 -GIT is a Version control technique. And it is a open source system.

-to initialise git 
git initi
vi file name
i to insert the details
Esc+:x and hit Enter to save the details

1. vi one.txt
2. enter and save file
3. git initi
4. git add one.txt
5. git commit
6. git status

-Working Directory 
-Staging Area
-localrepo

-Create a .txt file in your directory
-add to git 
   git add filename
-check the satus 
   git status
-to move the file from local directory to staging area 
   git commit -m "Give your own comments"
-To check the log
    git log 
	git log --oneline

-Tag concept

-To track or to see the changes to the file in staging area
   git diff filename



How to config user name ?
How to delete a file only from one localtion but not from both the locations?
How to see the file in both the locations ? what is the coomand ?

Branching is Folder structure
git checkout -b b1
-Stashing
Moving our data from working directory to temporary stashing
-github.com

-Jenkins
CI-Continuous Integration, this is possible via Jenkins
CB-CT-CDY
-This can be automated by using Jenkins
-Jenkins is a open source
-Code built tool example is MAVEN
-

18/03/2019
-Creating Master & Slave NODS in Jenkins
-Docker
Configuration Management 
-Configuration Management tool are Puppet and Ansible
Puppet
Ansible 
-Here, we write code to manage our Infrastructure  that is called as IAC
-IAC language depends on the CM tool 
-For Pupet it is Puppet DSL
-For Ansible it is YAML
-For Windows DS it is Powershell
-Puppet is a Agent based tool
 Puppet Master (for Master Node) and Puppet Agent (For Slave Node)
-Puppet Master should only be installed on Linux only
-Puppet slave/node/agent can be installed on Linux or Windows
-Puppet catalogue contains 
 Variable, Classes, manifest
-port 8140

19/03/2019
-Installing Puppet
- Manifest are the Puppet programs
  ends with .pp
-Resource can be anything with the puupet
  like file, resource
 
21/03/2019
-Ansible
 Modules-- it is Imp to perform Ansible activities
 Inventory--To categorise the group of servers
 Playbooks--Conncets the modules with Inventories
-ssh is an authentication mechanism
 used mainly for communication 
-ANSIBLE  is a pushed based command tool
 it uses YAML language - Ain't Markup Language



 





 



Doubts
1. gitignore topic
2. 


Commnets:
Check the status of Jenkins in putty 
sudo service Jenkins status
 
15/03/2019
-MAVEN is only for Java 
It is build automation tool
MAVEN follows the below process
-Compile
-Code Review
-Testing
-Package
-Deployment
-QA Metric job
PMD-Program mistake dictator

Preparation notes 
Continuous Integration is
GIT->Continuous Build->Continuous Testing->Continuous Deployment
