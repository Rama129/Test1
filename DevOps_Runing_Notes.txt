-Version Control
 To get all modified code level changes and track those changes and with more details
 To track the changes of the original local file. Like which developer changed and who saved those changes and kind of details
 To maintain logs of the files
-We have 3 Version control technique
 Centralized
 Distributed/Grid/Decentralized
 Local
-Centralized Version Control Technique
 One server is available to all the developers 
 Always depends on Network availability
 Only one at a time can commit the changes to the centralized server file
 If server is unavailable then none of the users can use the server files
-Distributed/Grid/Decentralized
 In this concept, developer has local repository and all the changes first commited in Local repository then moves it to the Central server
 So all the changes are initially saved locally
 For On Premise they use Bit Bucket
 For Cloud environment they use gethub and getlab
-In this concept the file changes and commited to staging area then only goes to localrepo and then moved to Remote Server
 1.Working Directory (gitadd)
 2.Staging area(git commit)
 3.Localrepo(gitpush)
 4.Remote Repo(git pull/git push)
